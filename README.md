Did you know that over 157,100 species are currently listed on The IUCN Red List, with more than 44,000 facing extinction threats? This includes staggering percentages like 41% of amphibians, 37% of sharks and rays, and 26% of mammals, among others. The urgency to protect biodiversity has never been greater.
